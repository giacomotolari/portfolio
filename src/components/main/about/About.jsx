          I am a 30 year old guy from Italy (Sardinia), I love sport, music and
          cooking (more eating).

          I like the idea of being able to work with people from all over the
          world, peole of different professions, knowing that I will never stop
          learning and that I will be able to use my imagination in my work,
          which is why I chose to become a Web Developer.
